# NAFEMS-SWG Benchmark Problem 2022 - Uncertain Knowledge

This is an open repository containing the codes used to tackle the challenge problems. Details to the challenge problems can be found on the PDF document titled: "benchmark_april_2022_article.pdf".

## Challenge Problem 1:
Run the MATLAB code named "NAFEMS_Problem_1.m" followed by the R code named "NAFEMS1.R"

## Challenge Problem 2:
For the log model evidence analysis, run the MATLAB files "Cluster1.m" and "Cluster2.m" to run 100 simulations of the Bayesian model updating for the Scaled Beta and Normal distribution models respectively. Recommeded to run these files on a High-performance cluster for the parallel computing process.

Following this, run the MATLAB code named "NAFEMS_Problem_2.m" followed by the R code named "NAFEMS2.R"
